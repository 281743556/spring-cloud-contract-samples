= Contracts in an external repository

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts in a separate repository.

include::../scenarios.adoc[]

== Flow

image::{images_folder}/flow.png[title="Consumer Driven Contract flow"]

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/external_consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned repo with contracts"]

IMPORTANT: For the sake of this tutorial let's assume that our consumer application is called
`beer-api-consumer`

==== IDE setup

include::snippets/consumer_ide_setup.adoc[]

==== Cloning the repo with contracts

- In this tutorial we will not clone the repo with contracts, we'll just
open it in the IDE (the repo is called `beer_contracts`)

==== Adding dependencies in the repo with contracts

- Since we want the IDE to help us with code completion, let's add the necessary Spring Cloud Contract
dependencies to the `pom.xml` under `beer_contracts` repo. You need to
add `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` as a dependency
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+
IMPORTANT: Notice that we're adding the dependency in the `compile` scope. That's because
 we want all of the contracts to be packaged as if they were production code
- This task will be performed once only. When you'll be adding any subsequent contracts
you won't be able to add it again.

==== Creating the proper folder structure

- In order to use repo with contracts you need to set up the folders so that they follow
the following convention
  ** `/slash/separated/group/id/of/producer/producer-artifactid/consumer-name/`
  ** in this tutorial our producer will have coordinates `com.example:beer-api-producer-external`
  and our consumer will be called `beer-api-consumer`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd beer_contracts
$ mkdir -p src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/messaging
$ mkdir -p src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/rest
----
- We have successfully created the proper folder structure. Time to add some contracts

==== Defining first HTTP contract

- Let' move to the `src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/`
folder . (<<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,Show solution>>)

include::snippets/first_http_contract.adoc[]

==== Defining second HTTP contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Under `src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/rest`
create a file called `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Set the `age` in the request to `17`
  * Update the response body to return a `status` equal to `NOT_OK`.
  * Update the description

==== Defining first messaging contract

- Ok we've done the case for HTTP. Let's move to the `src/main/resources/contracts/com/example/beer-api-producer-external/beer-api-consumer/messaging` folder

include::snippets/first_messaging_contract.adoc[]
* Congratulations! You've created your first messaging contract!

==== Defining second messaging contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldSendRejectedVerification.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Set the `eligible` in the response body to `false`
  * Update the label to `rejected_verification`
  * Update the description

====  Setting up Spring Cloud Contract in the producer contracts config file inside contracts repo

- In case of repo with contracts we need a way for the consumer to convert the contracts into stubs
and install them locally. At the moment the easiest way seems to be usage of Maven or Gradle to do so.
- In this tutorial we'll use Maven. Below you can see how the `pom.xml` should look like. (you can also
find it under `beer_contracts/example/pom.xml`).
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{contracts}/example/pom.xml[tags=config]
</project>
----
  * This configuration file
    ** sets the jar name to the `beer-api-producer-external` (that's how the producer's called)
    ** disables test generation (we want only to generate stubs)
    ** adds the Spring Cloud Contract plugin (as you can see there's no configuration related
    to base classes)
    ** `excludeBuildFolders` - pretty descriptive. When generating stubs `target` / `build` folders are generated
    and we don't want them in the output jar
    ** `contractsDirectory` - by default Spring Cloud Contract searches under `src/test/resources/contracts` folder
    but in this case we have the contracts under `/` (from the point of view of the `pom.xml`)
- Now as consumers we would like to convert the contracts into stubs so that we can play
 with the API. We'll use Maven to achieve that.
+
IMPORTANT: You need a standalone version of Maven installed!
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
----
- Now we have successfully installed the stubs locally...
  * You can check out `target/stubs/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` folder.
  Over there you'll see `contracts` folder where all contracts got copied and the `mappings` folder where you'll find all the
  generated stubs. By default Spring Cloud Contract uses http://wiremock.org[WireMock] as an implementation
  of fake HTTP server. Under the `beer/rest` subfolder you'll see all the generated stubs. Notice that
  we're using JSON Paths to check the contents of the request.

include::snippets/consumer_implementation.adoc[]

include::snippets/consumer_implementation_2.adoc[]
- Congratulations! As consumers - we've successfully played around with the API of the producer both for
HTTP and messaging. Now we're filing a PR to the repo that stores all contracts.

=== Producer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/external_producer_flow_1.png[title="Producer takes over the PR filed to the repo with contracts, writes missing impl on the producer side"]

==== IDE setup

- Open in your IDE the `producer_with_external_contracts` project (either via Maven or Gradle)
- We're assuming that we've taken over the PR of the `beer_contracts`. Example of how to achieve that in "real life" for a PR
that got submitted to via a branch called `the_pr` looks like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
git fetch origin
git checkout -b the_pr origin/the_pr
git merge master
----

- The idea of Spring Cloud Contract is about stub and contract validity. Right now we have a set of
 contracts defined but we haven't tested it against the producer side. Time to change that!

==== Install the contracts locally

- In order for the producer to profit from the contracts we need to produce a JAR with all the contracts.
- To achieve that we'll use the Maven's assembly plugin.
  * the configuration you can find under `beer_contracts/src/assembly/contracts.xml`
  * still we need to configure the `beer_contracts/pom.xml` by providing the assembly plugin configuration
+
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
      <execution>
          <id>contracts</id>
          <phase>prepare-package</phase>
          <goals>
              <goal>single</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
              <attach>true</attach>
              <descriptor>${basedir}/src/assembly/contracts.xml</descriptor>
              <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId>
          </configuration>
      </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----
  * what this will do is it will create in `target` folder a `beer-contracts` JAR that will
  contain all contracts and poms from `src/main/resources/contracts`

==== Setting up the Spring Cloud Contract dependencies on the producer side

- First let's add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier dependency to the project
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testCompile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier")
----
- Spring Cloud Contract can generate tests from your contracts to ensure that your implementation's API
is compatible with the defined contract. Let's set up the project to start generating tests.
  * Spring Cloud Contract needs a base class that all of the generated tests will extend. Currently
  we support 3 different ways of defining a base class (you can read more about this in the
  Spring Cloud Contract documentation for https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin[Gradle]
  and https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_configure_plugin_2[Maven])
    ** a single class for all tests
    ** convention based naming (takes 2 last package names and appends `Base`. Having a contract
    `src/test/resources/contracts/foo/bar/shouldDoSth.groovy` would create a test class called
    `BarTest` that would extend `FooBarBase` class.
    ** manual mapping (you can state that contracts matching certain regular expression will have to
    have a base class with fully qualified name equal to X)
  * In the following example we'll play with manual mapping like this:
+

contracts {
	// We want to use the JAR with contracts with the following coordinates
	contractDependency {
		stringNotation = 'com.example:beer-contracts'
	}
	// The JAR with contracts should be taken from Maven local
	contractsWorkOffline = true
	// Base package for generated tests
	basePackageForTests = "com.example"
	baseClassMappings {
		baseClassMapping(".*messaging.*", "com.example.BeerMessagingBase")
		baseClassMapping(".*rest.*", "com.example.BeerRestBase")
	}
}
----
    ** In both cases we're defining that we want to download the JAR with contracts
    with given coordinates (`com.example:beer-contracts`)
    ** We're not providing the `contractsRepositoryUrl` - so the URL from which we'd like
    the contracts to be downloaded since we want to work offline. That's why we set the
    `contractsWorkOffline` flag.
    ** We've decided that all the generated tests will be generated under `com.example` package
    instead of the default one
    ** We've manually set mappings of packages in which contracts are stored to a fully
    qualified name of the base class. That means that if there's a contract that has a
    `messaging` package name in its path then it will be mapped to a `com.example.BeerMessagingBase`
    base class

==== Updating contracts from the PR

include::snippets/updating_messaging_contracts_from_pr.adoc[]
+
IMPORTANT: Remember to rebuild the JAR with contracts in the `beer_contracts` repo. You
need to produce and install the JAR in your Maven local

include::snippets/producer_implementation.adoc[]

=== Producer flow 2

image::{images_folder}/external_producer_flow_2.png[title="Once done the producer merges the PR to the repo with contracts. The CI system will produce a JAR with all contracts"]

- Now you would merge the PR from `beer_contracts` repo to master and your CI system would build a fat jar and stubs

=== Producer flow 3

image::{images_folder}/external_producer_flow_3.png[title="Once the PR got merged, the CI built the JAR of the contracts repo then the producer's code can use that JAR in its own building process"]

- After the PR got merged and the `beer-contracts` artifact would get published you need to
switch off your offline work in the Spring Cloud Contract (we won't be doing this for this tutorial).
In "real life" situation you would need to update it like this:
