= Contracts representing scenarios (stateful stubs)

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts together with the producer code.
In the contracts we'll describe a stateful scenario where the stub needs
to have "memory" to know what the previous state was and what the next one
should be.

== Scenarios

== Flow

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

==== IDE setup

- Open in your IDE the `consumer` project (either via Maven or Gradle)
- In this scenario we'll have to just write a test for HTTP communication
  * the consumer gets asked about the current and previous state of intoxication of a given person
  * the more you drink the more intoxicated you get
  * the flow of intoxication looks like this `SOBER` -> `TIPSY` -> `DRUNK` -> `WASTED`
  * the consumer asks the producer for a beer for a given person
  and in return the information about the state of intoxication is sent back
- In the standard CDC process we would be doing TDD but here you already
have some code ready
  * The test `IntoxicationControllerTest` contains tests of our feature
  * In the `IntoxicationController` we'll need to call an endpoint on the producer
  side
- Let's first write our missing test
  * There's already a method `sendARequestAndExpectStatuses` created for us to
  fill out
  * We want to use the `MockMvc` to send a request to the `/wasted` endpoint
   with the name `marcin` in the JSON request body. As a response we expect
   to get the `previousStatus` and `currentStatus` of intoxication
+
[source,java]
----
include::{consumer}/src/test/java/com/example/intoxication/IntoxicationControllerTest.java[tags=test]
----
- If we run this test it will obviously fail cause we don't have any implementation
in the `IntoxicationController`. We would like to write the implementation
but we don't yet know the structure of the request
- Since we don't know how the API should look like, we'll clone the producer's
code to play around with their API

include::snippets/setup_cloned_producer.adoc[]

==== Defining the stateful HTTP contracts

- In the producer's clone let's create a `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/intoxication`
folder
- In Spring Cloud Contract you can define steps for a given scenario by naming convention
of the files
  * if your contract file starts with a number and a `_` character then it's assumed to be
  part of scenario
  * example: `1_sober.groovy`, `2_tipsy.groovy`, `3_drunk.groovy`
- Let's create those three files and let's start writing our first scenario.
Open the `1_sober.groovy` file
    * We'll need to start by calling the `org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make` method
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

}
----
    * Now let's provide a meaningful description via the `description` method
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
    Represents first step of getting fully drunk

    given:
        you didn't drink anything
    when:
        you get a beer
    then:
        you'll be tipsy
    """)
}

    * Next let's define the `request` part of the contract

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

    * Congratulations! You have successfully created your first contract!
- Now define 2 next contracts `2_tipsy.groovy` and `3_drunk.groovy`. You can
check out the <<_scenario_contracts,solution>>
    * The first transition will be from `TIPSY` -> `DRUNK`
    * The last transition will be from `DRUNK` -> `WASTED`
- We have managed to define all scenarios. Now we would like to generate
the stubs so that we can reuse them on the consumer side. To that
we'll need to set up the Spring Cloud Contract plugin in the cloned
repository

include::snippets/setting_plugin_on_clone.adoc[]

    * If you check out the `1_sober.json` intoxication stub you'll notice the
    following section
+
[source,json]
----
"scenarioName" : "Scenario_intoxication",
"requiredScenarioState" : "Started",
"newScenarioState" : "Step1"
----
    * In this section WireMock is told that
        ** Name of the scenario is `Scenario_intoxication`. The name comes from the
        folder in which the contracts were placed
        ** The required scenario state is `Started` - that's the initial state
        ** The next step is `Step1` - every subsequent step will be called `Step` with
        appended appropriate number
    * If you check out the `2_tipsy.json` you'll notice that the required
     values of previous and next states got updated:
+
[source,json]
----
"scenarioName" : "Scenario_intoxication",
"requiredScenarioState" : "Step1",
"newScenarioState" : "Step2"
----
- We have managed to install the stubs locally - it's time to move back to our
consumer test
- Let's open the `IntoxicationController` class and write the missing implementation.
You can try yourself or check out the <<_intoxication_controller,solution>>

==== Turning on Stub Runner in HTTP consumer tests

- After writing the implementation, if we rerun the tests we will get
a connection refused exception. That's because we haven't started the HTTP
server with the stubs

include::snippets/stub_runner_http_consumer_tests.adoc[]

- Congratulations! You have successfully created the contracts, defined the
API that suits your needs and wrote the consumer part of the functionality!
Now it's time to create a PR with the contract proposal and file it to
the producer side

=== Producer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/producer_flow_1.png[title="Producer takes over the PR, writes missing impl and merges the PR"]

include::snippets/producer_flow.adoc[]
+
IMPORTANT: We were setting the plugin in the following since most likely you're
using the same `producer` codebase as you have for previous tutorials. That's
why we want the other tests to still pass. If that's not the case (if you
have only just started with this particular tutorial) then you can remove
the `packageWithBaseClasses` entry

* The intoxication base class lays under the `intoxication` folder. Let's
use the `baseClassMappings` to set point the plugin to proper base classes
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>

                <contractPackageRegex>.*intoxication.*</contractPackageRegex>
                <baseClassFQN>com.example.intoxication.BeerIntoxicationBase</baseClassFQN>
            </baseClassMapping>
        </baseClassMappings>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
contracts {
	packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example'
	baseClassMappings {
		baseClassMapping(".*intoxication.*", "com.example.intoxication.BeerIntoxicationBase")
	}
}
----

==== Generating tests from contracts

- Let's generate the tests! Just call:
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
----
  * Suddenly some tests should start failing. Those tests are the autogenerated tests created
  by Spring Cloud Contract
  * The tests lay under `/generated-test-sources/contracts/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/tests/beer`
    in `target` for Maven or `build` for Gradle
  * There will be a test for each folder in which you store your contracts. The name of the test class
    will be the name of that folder
  * Each of the contracts will be a single test inside that test class
  * If you check out the generated `IntoxicationTest` you'll notice that it got
  annotated with `@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)` in order to ensure
  that the tests are executed sequentially
- Time to fix the broken tests. We need to do that by providing the missing implementation.

==== Fixing broken HTTP tests

- Let's start with HTTP
  * First let's write the missing implementation in `BeerServingController`. The logic to be written
    is extremely simple - the `responseProvider.thereYouGo(...)` returns the `Response`. So
    the implementation is basically a one liner
+
[source,java]
----
return this.responseProvider.thereYouGo(customer);
----
- Let's fix the `BeerIntoxicationBase` class now
  * The idea of CDC is *NOT TO TEST* every single feature. Contract tests are there to see if the API
    is matched, *NOT* that the feature is working. That's why we shouldn't be accessing databases etc.
    That means that we will work with a fake instance of the `ResponseProvider`.
  * Let's start with writing the missing implementation of the `MockResponseProvider`
  (<<_beerintoxicationbase,Show solution>>).
  You'll need to:
    ** ensure that the `name` is equal to `marcin`
    ** depending on the `current` state you'll need to set the `previous` and
    `current` one and create the `Response`
  * We'll need to maintain state between the tests. If you try to store the state
  in a field in a base class then you'll loose it between test executions cause
   JUnit is reinitializing all the fields. We can fix that by setting up
   a small Spring Context that will be reused. That's why you can see that the test
   is annotated with
+
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(classes = BeerIntoxicationBase.Config.class)
----
  * We want RestAssured and MockMvc to reuse the web context that we have in our
  test - that's why we need to set it up using the following notation
+
[source,java]
----
    @Autowired WebApplicationContext webApplicationContext;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        RestAssuredMockMvc.webAppContextSetup(webApplicationContext);
    }
----
- Now try re-running the build to regenerate the tests and the tests should pass
- Now you would merge the PR to master and your CI system would build a fat jar and stubs
- Congratulations - you've completed the producer side of this tutorial
