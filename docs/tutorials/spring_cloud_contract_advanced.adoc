= Spring Cloud Contract Advanced

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts together with the producer code and we'll check
out more advanced concepts behind Spring Cloud Contract.

== Scenarios

We'll try to code the following scenario:

image::{images_folder}/grumpy_1.png[title="Grumpy bartender that doesn't want to sell any alcohol"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{images_folder}/grumpy_2.png[title="But the beer will always be sold to Josh Long"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

== Flow

image::{images_folder}/flow.png[title="Consumer Driven Contract flow"]

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

IMPORTANT: This tutorial assumes that you've completed the previous tutorials and the consumer
code has been already set up with appropriate dependencies.

- Let's open the `GrumpyBartenderControllerTest`
- First step will be to write the missing implementation of the tests. Basing on the requirements
presented above
+
[source,java]
----
include::{consumer}/src/test/java/com/example/GrumpyBartenderControllerTest.java[tags=tests]
----
- If we run the tests - obviously they will fail. Let's now check out the producer's code
to define the missing contract. Open the `producer_advanced` project

==== Cloned producer

- As usual we will not clone the producer's code but that's what we would actually do
in a real life scenario.
- Under `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/rest/` create a `shouldNotSellAnyAlcohol.groovy` file
- Now let's write our contract!
- You can define the contracts using Groovy DSL. Let's create our first HTTP contract.
  * Call the `Contract.make` method to start defining the contract
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

}
----

  * You can call `description()` method to provide some meaningful description. TIP: You can use the
   Groovy multiline String `""" """` to have all special characters escaped. Every new line in the String
   will be converted into a new line character. Example
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
}
----

  * Now call the `request { }` and `response { }` methods
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

  * Let's assume that we're interested in sending a `POST` method. Call `method POST()` or `method "POST"`.
  TIP: In Groovy you don't need to provide parentheses (in most cases). You can write either `method POST()`
  or `method(POST())`. In both cases it's the same syntax
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now we need to provide some URL. Let it be `/buy`. Let's write `url "/buy"`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/buy"
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now time to define some body. We want to define an `age` and `name` fields.
  Let's make `name` accept any alpha unicode value. Let's make `age` be a concrete value
  at this time. We will make it dynamic in the next step
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * As you can see we've used the `$()` method where we've
  used the `anyAlphaUnicode()` function to set a dynamic value.
  * Lets now try to make the `age` dynamic. In Spring Cloud Contract you can either provide
  the dynamic values directly in the body (as we have with the `name`) or via `stubMatchers`
  and `testMatchers` sections. Let's use the first one. We'll define the JSON path for
  which we want to define a dynamic value.
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
    }
    stubMatchers {
        jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Inside the `stubMatchers` section we've defined that an element matching a JSON
  path `$.age` has to match a regular expression of `[2-9][0-9]`. You can check out
  that there are other methods than `byRegex`. You can read about them in the
  https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_dynamic_properties_in_matchers_sections[documentation].
+
IMPORTANT: If you provide a value via the matchers section then the value for the key for which
you've added the matching will get *removed* from automatic test assertion generation.
You'll have to provide those values manually via the matchers section.
  * Now time for the headers... Call the `headers { }` method
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {

        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Inside that method let's define that we want to use the `Content-Type: "application/json"` header. Just
  call `contentType(applicationJson())` methods
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Congratulations! You defined how you would like the contract for the request to look like! Time for the
  response
  * In the `response` block we would like to define that that the status of our response will be 200.
  Just call `status 200`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
    }
}
----
  * We'd like our response to have some body. We'll have the `message` and `status` fields.
  In the `message` we will want to respond with `You're drunk [name from request]. Go home!`
  For the `status` we will want to always return a `NOT_OK` value and in our tests
  have a custom assertion.
  * Let's start with the `message` field. Spring Cloud Contract gives you a method
  `fromRequest()` that allows you to point in the response that you would like to
  fetch some values from the request. In our case the value we want to take is inside
  the request body under `$.name` JSON path. That's why we can set the value of `message` to
  `"You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",`. Note that we have a `""`
  Groovy String with a `${}` String interpolation in which we're calling the `fromRequest()`
  method. Enough of talking - let's write some code!
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!"
        )
    }
}
----
  * Ok we've got the message response that references the request. Time for the second
  field. Until now we've been always providing a single value for the dynamic parts
  of the contract. Whenever we have dynamic values on one side (consumer / producer) then
  on the other we need a concrete value. We can provide that value manually. For the
  response in the stub we need to provide a concrete value equal to `NOT_OK`.
  For the generated test we want to have a custom assertion done via the `assertStatus()` method
  defined in the base class. To achieve that we need to write `$(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))`
  Let's now analyze this syntax.
    ** `c()` is a shortcut for `consumer()` and `p()` for `producer().
  Via `$(c(),p())` , in this case, we're providing a concrete value for the consumer and
  a dynamic one for the producer
    ** The `$(c("NOT_OK"),...)` means that for the response in the stub, for the fields `status`
     we want the stub to contain the value `NOT_OK`
    ** The `$(...,p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))` means that we want on the producer side,
    in the autogenerated tests, to execute a method defined in the base class. That method's
    called `assertStatus()`. As a parameter of that method we want to pass the value of
    an element present in the response JSON. In our case we're providing a dynamic value for
    the `$.status` field. `assertStatus($it)` will get translated to
    `assertStatus(read the $.status from the response JSON)`
  * Enough of talking - let's write the response body
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        Represents a grumpy waiter that is too bored to sell any alcohol for anyone.
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
            name: $(anyAlphaUnicode()),
            age: 25
            )
        }
        stubMatchers {
            jsonPath('$.age', byRegex('[2-9][0-9]'))
        }
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body(
            message: "You're drunk [${fromRequest().body('$.name')}]. Go home!",
            status: $(c("NOT_OK"), p(execute('assertStatus($it)')))
        )
    }
}
----
  * Now let us assume that actually we want to perform some more complex analysis of
  the `message` field via a method called `assertMessage()`. There's another way to do that -
  we can call the `testMatchers` section.
  * Under `testMatchers` we can define via JSON Path the element we would like
  to dynamically assert. Let's add this section
+

  * We're almost done. We wrote a very generic example that will catch a person with any name.
  But in the requirements it was written that a `starbuxman` person always has to get the beer.
  So we will have a specific case of our generic one. That's we will set the `priority` to `100`

@Autowired StubFinder stubFinder;

@Before
public void setupPort() {

----
  * Let's go with the first option. We want to inject the value of the port
  of the running stub to the controller.
- Now if we run the tests then they should pass successfully
- Congratulations! As consumers - we've successfully played around with the API of the producer both for
HTTP and messaging. Now we're filing a PR to their code with the proposal of contract and let's switch to
the producer side.

==== Fixing broken HTTP tests

- The generated tests have failed. We need to fix it by providing
the missing assert methods in the base class. We also need to
setup RestAssured. Let's start with the first one
- Go to `BeerRestBase`
- Add the missing `assertStatus(String status)` and `assertMessage(String message)`
methods (<<_missing_assert_methods,or copy from the solution>>)
    * `assertStatus` should assert that the `status` is equal to `NOT_OK`
    * `assertMessage` should assert that the `message` contains `Go home!`
- Also we need to add the missing Rest Assured setup. We just want to
add the `BuyController` into the list of standalone setup
+
[source,java]
----
RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(..., new BuyController(), ...);
----
- This time we will not play with mocking in the base class
cause we've already done that in the previous tutorials. We'll try to
make our tests pass as fast as possible.
+
IMPORTANT: we want our Controller to use the async servlet functionality,
that's why we need it to return a `Callable<Response>`
- That's why we need to write our implementation of the controller (<<_buycontroller,or copy from the solution>>).
    * POST method to the `/buy` endpoint that produces and consumes JSON
    * The incoming `Person` name if
        ** equal to `starbuxman` should return `status` `OK` and `message`
        `There you go Josh!`
        ** not equal to `starbuxman` should return `status` `NOT_OK` and `message`
         (example for name equal `foo`) `You're drunk [foo]. Go home!`
- Now if you run the build again then your autogenerated tests will... still fail!
- The reason for that is that we're using the async servlet feature but
Rest Assured doesn't know about this. To fix this we need to add in the
response side of our contracts the `async()` method. (<<_grumpy_contracts,Check the solution>>).
- Now if you run the build again then your tests should pass.
