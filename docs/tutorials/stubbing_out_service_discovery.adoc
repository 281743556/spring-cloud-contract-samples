= Contracts on the producer side

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts together with the producer code. On
the consumer side we'll be using Service Discovery.

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

- Let's go back to our, consumer's code. We'll be looking at `BeerControllerTest` and `BeerController`.
We know how we would like the API to look like so now we can write the missing implementation in the
`BeerController`.
- Remember that in order for you to use the load balancing features
we'll need to add the `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-eureka` dependency!
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-eureka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-eureka")
----
- Also you need to register the `RestTemplate` bean as `@LoadBalanced`. Go to
the `ClientApplication` class and register the bean as follows
+
[source,java]
----
@Bean
@LoadBalanced
RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
}
----
- Now let's assume that we will be calling the producer application via the
`http://somenameforproducer/check` URL.
- You'll need to provide some properties to tell Stub Runner that the given
service name (in our case `somenameforproducer`) should mapped to the running HTTP server
stub of a given producer. Let's set those properties
  * Stub Runner requires you to set the `stubrunner.idsToServiceIds` mapping in which
  the key is the artifact id and the value is the service name in the code
  * define the following property
+
[source,yml]
----
stubrunner:
  idsToServiceIds:
    beer-api-producer: somenameforproducer
----
  * that means that when you call the URL `http://somenameforproducer/check` it will
  get redirected to a fake HTTP instance that was started with `beer-api-producer` stubs JAR
- We know how the API needs to look like so now go ahead and try to write the missing implementation
  of the `BeerController`

==== Turning on Stub Runner in HTTP consumer tests

==== Playing with the HTTP contracts

include::snippets/playing_with_http_contracts.adoc[]

- Congratulations! As consumers - we've successfully played around with the API of the producer both for
HTTP and messaging. Now we're filing a PR to their code with the proposal of contract and let's switch to
the producer side.

=== Producer flow 1

==== Updating contracts from the PR

include::snippets/producer_http_tests.adoc[]
- Now you would merge the PR to master and your CI system would build a fat jar and stubs
- Congratulations - you've completed the producer side of this tutorial
